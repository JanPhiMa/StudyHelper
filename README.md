 ## How to install the StudyHelper:
 
 ### Build yourself...
 
 What you require is the code from this repository. You can download it manually in the top right corner of the repository (or fire up your shell,
 switch to the designated location on your Computer and type "git clone https://github.com/JanPhiMa/StudyHelper". Make sure you have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for that.) 
 
 This will download the repository in that very folder. After that, open the project with AndroidStudio, either connect your Android phone or create a virtual device, and hit "run" above the space where the open tabs are shown. 
 This button is represented as a green triangle.
